# Rambooks

Rambooks is a school project that I took out of my shelf to work again, but with some differences: The technologies used on it.

The design of the project gave me more encouragement to go deeper into things like Medias Queries and ways to make my layout match what was envisioned, 
and while this may not be my first project that I worked on, it's the one that I kinda liked the most. With that in mind, I think I got to the part that most people will relate: 
Getting something that you liked to do, a project that you liked, and using it as a way to progress on your studies.


<h1> The initial idea behind it </h1>

Well, since we could choose a theme for our page, my idea was to get something that I was close by, and try to build something around it. So I choose to use 
my name as the brand(creativity +100) and with the help of a friend, we both got into Figma to create something out of many ideas that I had in my mind. 
What I wanted was a simple and clean design, that could also be easily identified by it's home page. I didn't want to throw a bunch of information around, 
since I feel that this is not the point for a home page. So, a compact, but with an easyly spotable theme was created.


<h1> How did it developed? </h1>

At first, I was really unfamiliar with CSS, my idea was to focus on putting every info in order, without styles or anything, than start it. 
The initial developtment was not using React, it was just a training of our HTML/CSS skills. Since I was still with Flutter/VueJS fresh on my memory, I've
tried to make it a little more structured, even if it was just comments on parts of the CSS to separate one part from another, or giving info on what was changing.

Picking this up from where I left, it was actually pretty easy to pass this to React, and making parts of the page components is a bless. No more one page text walls.
Components are the things that I most love when learning new techologies: It's not a hard thing to do, and it makes code so much clean and easy to understand.


<h1> Is it online? </h1>

**Yes**. Since I don't want to turn this into a text wall, I will use this section to show shiny pictures and a link of my project.

<h1> Final Thoughts </h1>

Front end was something that I had alot of dificulty, but over time it grew on me. It is pretty fun to develop things from scratch, even tho I'm still just 
a begginer, and while this may not be a perfect project, I'm pretty happy from what I'm achieving while studying. I feel like as a begginer, you will always
hit a wall on some error, but the thing is, as long as you keep up with studies, this walls will consume less and less of your time, at least that's how I feel today.

This is also the first time I engage writing things on git, so I'm pretty happy about that. This won't be the last update on this project, since I know there is many fixes I still wan't to do.
I'm not really got at wraping things up so I will just leave a random phrase that I got from the project at the bottom of this:
"A signature can get you thousands of books, and a thousand people checking this project out can get me a job". Thank you, **I'll see myself out**.
